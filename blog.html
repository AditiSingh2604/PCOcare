        <h2>Do I have PCOS?</h2>
        <p>If you're reading this article, there's a good chance you might be wondering whether you have PCOS. If so, 
            then you're in the right place. We're going to take a closer look at the different polycystic ovary syndrome 
            symptoms and walk you through what to expect from a diagnosis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div3">
        <h2>Most common PCOS symptoms</h2>
        <p>First of all, let's make sure we all know what PCOS actually is. A common hormonal disorder, it can have three main signs or symptoms: 
        </p>
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li> <p> Missed or irregular periods</p> </li>
                <li> <p>A high level of hormones called androgens (also known as “male” hormones)</p> </li> 
                <li> <p> Polycystic ovaries (when small egg sacs on the ovaries fill with fluid)</p> </li>
           </ul>
          <br><br>
           <p> As we'll explain in more detail, you don't need to have all three of the symptoms to get a diagnosis. Instead, if you have two 
            out of the three symptoms listed above and there's no other clear explanation as to why you're experiencing them, that's when a 
            doctor will typically diagnose PCOS. <br><br>
            You might be wondering what causes PCOS, but scientists don't yet have a definitive answer to that question. However, they do 
            believe you might be more likely to have PCOS if you are insulin resistant (which means your body can't regulate blood sugar in the 
            way it should), if you have a family history of it, or if you are overweight (which means you have a body mass index above 25).

        <h2>PCOS symptoms checklist</h2>
        <p>As we now know, you'll need to be displaying at least two of the three key symptoms of PCOS listed above in order to be diagnosed 
            with the condition. But beyond that, there are several other indicators that you might have polycystic ovary syndrome. It's 
            always useful to be aware of the other signs and symptoms, so we run through them below. And remember, if you think you might
            have PCOS, reach out to your doctor so they can investigate. 
        </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Missed or irregular periods</h3>
            <p>We already know that missed or irregular periods are one of the most common signs of PCOS, but why? “In order to ovulate on 
                a regular monthly basis, there is a precise [mix] of hormones that must occur, the bottom line is that 
                PCOS alters the ratio of hormones necessary for ovulation and [therefore disrupts] a regular menstrual cycle.”<br><br>
                This is because the high level of androgens, or “male” hormones, that are present in PCOS can mean that the ovaries stop 
                releasing eggs regularly or might not release an egg at all. This can understandably have a secondary effect on your periods, 
                meaning that they could become irregular or even stop for a while. <br><br>
                If you stop ovulating due to PCOS, you might also notice that you sometimes experience heavy bleeding. Our ovaries usually 
                produce a balance of estrogen and progesterone, but if they stop ovulating, they'll also stop producing progesterone.This 
                could result in the uterus lining growing too much or becoming too thick, which can lead to occasional episodes of abnormal 
                bleeding called “anovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding.” This bleeding is likely to be heavier and last longer than a 
                normal period.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Excessive hair growth or hair thinning and hair loss</h3>
          <p>The high levels of androgens that often go hand in hand with PCOS could also have an impact on your hair growth. First, you might 
            find that dark or coarse hair grows on your arms, chest, face, or abdomen, this excessive hair growth 
            is called hirsutism. It's common in PCOS and thought to affect up to 70% of women who have the condition. <br><br>
            In contrast, you might also notice hair loss or thinning, which can be another upsetting sign of PCOS. "Androgens are the main 
            regulators of hair follicles, the response to androgens changes depending on what part of the body the follicle 
            is housed in. They [can] cause small vellus hair [the soft hair that grows on most of your body] to change into larger terminal hairs 
            [longer and darker hairs]. On the scalp, androgens can inhibit hair growth.”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Acne and oily skin</h3>
            <p>
                Just when you thought that androgens couldn't get any more troublesome, they can also cause your skin to become oily and produce 
               spots. This acne is likely to be present on your face, back, or chest, and it might be harder to treat than normal acne. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Insulin resistance, weight issues, and diabetes</h3>
            <p>
                If you have insulin resistance, your body can't use the insulin it produces in an effective way. This can lead to higher levels 
                of androgens in your body, making insulin resistance one of the causes of PCOS; 65% to 70% of people with the disorder are 
                affected by <br><br>
                Insulin resistance is, in turn, linked to weight gain because being overweight can be a cause of insulin 
                resistance (although it's worth noting that this isn't always the case; not everyone with insulin resistance is overweight).    
                <br><br>    
                Insulin resistance can also cause you to develop prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes (where your body no longer responds to insulin 
                or its response is impaired, leading to high blood sugar levels). It's estimated that over 50% of people with PCOS will 
                develop Type 2 diabetes by the time they reach the age of 40. <br><br>
                The good news is that making healthy adjustments to your 
                lifestyle, such as eating more healthily and moving more, could help to reverse insulin resistance and reduce your chances 
                of developing PCOS. In people who have excess weight, “losing 5% of [their] body weight can reduce circulating active androgens,”
            </p>

        <h2>Signs of PCOS: The takeaway</h2>
        <p>There are a number of polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms to look out for, all of which can have an impact on both your physical 
            and mental health. However, it's worth keeping in mind that PCOS is diagnosed by exclusion, so experiencing one of the symptoms 
            doesn't necessarily mean that you have the disorder; you'll need to have two out of the three main signs 
            (irregular menstrual periods, excess androgen levels, and polycystic ovaries) to be formally diagnosed by a doctor. <br><br>
             
            It's also worth remembering that PCOS affects around 5 million women in the United States alone and that there are a number 
             of effective treatment options available. So while a diagnosis can be understandably scary, you are certainly not alone, and help will
             be available.
